> The Tech for Equity Fellowship, an initiative by Duke Applied Machine Learning, is a student-run summer internship program that aims to bridge the gap between student technologists and non-profit organizations. The program provides Duke students with the opportunity to engage with community-based organizations, develop tech-driven solutions to pressing social issues, and connect with tech-for-social-change leaders at the ACLU, Vera Institute of Justice, and more.
